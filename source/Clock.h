/**
	The audio envelope's clock: seconds since the plugin's first frame, in
	double, from whatever the host hands SetTime.

	The map itself is a pure function of the frame and never reads the clock.
	Only the sea's audio drive has state across frames (a release, an onset
	baseline), and it needs an honest dt. Three problems, all inherited from
	the fleet:

	**What unit is the host's clock in?** The FFGL header never says. Resolume
	sends milliseconds; the offline harness and oxbow send seconds. The unit is
	voted on against a steady wall clock over the first few frames (readout's
	voting, by way of cadence and standards) and then stuck to. The harness
	DECLARES its unit, because it renders as fast as the GPU allows and there
	is nothing for the voting to measure.

	**Resolume's clock overflows a float.** It has been measured at ~499
	million ms, where a float resolves ~0.03 s. So the clock is kept as an
	origin and an offset in double, and nothing absolute reaches a shader.

	**A scrub, a loop or a stall is not a frame.** A delta that is backwards or
	longer than half a second steps the clock one nominal frame and reports
	`Jumped()`, and the audio detector re-primes on it rather than reading the
	jump as a very long, very quiet frame. Copied from standards unchanged.
